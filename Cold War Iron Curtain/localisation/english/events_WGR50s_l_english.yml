 WGRElection.1.d:0 "The first West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher have the majority of the votes. A minority party still able to wield some influence is the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) rumored to have Soviet assistance. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.2.d:0 "The second West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.3.d:0 "The third West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.4.d:0 "After the five-year long military government, Germany is ready once more for a provisional election. With the fracturing of the SPD, the two competing parties are now the Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the German Party and Free Democratic Party coalition led by Heinrich Hellwege and Franz Blucher. Who will win?"
 Starting.1.d:0 "May 23, 1949 will be a momentous day for German history forever! Today, the work of the Parliamentary Council has come to reality as the Grundgesetz was signed and promulgated. Composed of members of West German state parliaments, the Council drafted the document and approved it, 53 votes to 12, on May 8. It was then put forth to state parliaments, being finally approved by all except the Bavarian Lander. This document, including the formation of the German federal government and providing crucial rights to all its citizens, marks the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany."
 Starting.2.d:0 "“(1) The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.\n(2) All state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the people in elections and plebiscites and by means of separate legislative, executive, and judicial organs.\n(3) Legislation shall be limited by the constitution, the executive and the administration of justice by legislation and the law.”\n\nArticle 20 is one of the fundamental articles of the Basic Law, describing the governmental structure of the Federal Republic and guarantees democracy, republicanism, social responsibility and federalism, being more direct than the past Weimar Constitution. As well, Article 20 has the privilege of not being able to be removed from the Basic Law as it guarantees democracy for all."
 Starting.3.d:0 "“For the time being, this Basic Law shall apply in the territory of the Laender Baden, Bavaria, Bremen, Greater Berlin, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. It shall be put into force for other parts of Germany on their accession.”\n\nArticle 23 focuses on the German Lander, or states. The Lander have always had a large part in German unitary government, and this article provides other de jure German states, not included in the field of application of the Basic Law, to declare their accession, or Beitritt, at a later date. This is designed to give the Lander a fair opportunity to join the Federal Republic, assuming they are recognized by the federal government and declared their accession via free self-determination. This truly is a watershed moment for relations between the federal government and the Lander in German politics."
 Adenauer49.1.d:0 "The debate on the new capital for the Federal Republic is raging in the new Bundestag. Currently, the capital is located in the western city of Bonn, on the banks of the Rhine River. However, members of the SPD have argued for a relocation of the capital to the city of Frankfurt, arguing that the city already has the required facilities and that it would be 95 million marks cheaper. However, CDU members are pushing back, arguing that Bonn is the provisional capital and the capital should not be moved until all of Germany is reunited. Where shall the capital be?"
 Adenauer49.2.d:0 "“I am afraid that the Western Allies, instead of pursuing a European policy, are getting into a policy of interest which tends rather to prop up an authoritarian Adenauer regime than to allow it to be replaced by a democratic regime… What we have to debate and to vote on today is nothing but a test of whether the Basic Law is a scrap of paper and whether the majority can continue in its endeavors to ride roughshod over it…”\n\nThis brought applause from the SPD side, and interjections and boos from the CDU side of the Bundestag chamber. Herr Doktor Arndt of the SPD continued to speak.\n\n“We thought we were on the way to a parliamentary democracy and find ourselves on the way to a monarchy without a constitution... Herr Chancellor, we shall not let you forget this oath!”\n\nChancellor Adenauer rose to speak, noting that the trade unions of Germany were behind the government in their earnest desire to sign the Petersberg Agreement, even though it addressed dismantlement of industries. This prompted questions from the SPD opposition, questioning the validity of the claim. This debate continued to rage on, but a decision must be made, quickly."
 Adenauer49.3.d:0 "On 29 December 1948, the three Western Allies as well as the three Benelux countries issued the Ruhr Statute, a special system of ordering the workings of the Ruhr industry. The Ruhr Authority envisaged by the Statute, a body consisting of representatives of the six powers, was established on 28 April 1949, including provision for representatives of the Federal Republic as members of the Authority.\n\nThis prompted a clash of opinions between the Government and, above all, the Social Democratic opposition on a question closely connected with the problem of dismantling, namely that of recognizing the Ruhr Authority by sending a German representative. In practice the function of this Authority would amount to control of the entire German economy because of the overwhelming importance of the industrial area of the Ruhr for all economic life in Germany.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting, Chancellor Adenauer explained that participation in the Statute would have favorable consequences; if we refused, it would amount to obstruction, and therefore, a thaw in Allied relations.\n\nHowever, the other argument was that domestically, membership would not be popular and Government support would stumble, especially in Landtag elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. Which way shall Germany go?"
 Adenauer49.4.d:0 "To commemorate the new decade of the 1950s, Chancellor Adenauer addressed the collected Bundestag chamber, as well as high-ranking government officials in a New Year’s Address. Beginning after applause, mostly from the CDU side of the chamber, he began.\n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Bundestag, Cabinet Ministers, foreign dignitaries and all those present, we are entering a new age. Less than a year ago, the Federal Republic was founded, and as we enter the 1950s, Germany will only grow more and more. Our relationships with the Western Powers only grow, while we pursue unification of Germany into one democratic state, not one controlled by one political party. As we enter a new age of technological development, Germany will be on the leading edge of this innovation, as we consolidate our limited industrial use for good. As I stand here, a testament to European democracy and peace is shown, and this shall continue forevermore!”"
 Adenauer49.5.d:0 "The reactions to German rearmament proposals by the Allies have been mixed within the Federal Republic’s government. The SPD’s position on German participation in a European defense community has been indeed hostile, with Dr. Schumacher considering CDU offers for rearmament to be premature, and is afraid that the Americans would make an offer that they could not keep. However, the CDU argues that the Soviet threat is large enough to warrant a rapid German rearmament, and that if they did not align with the Allies, the Federal Republic could be swept into the Soviet bloc, and would lose our sovereignty."
 Adenauer49.6.d:0 "Today is a momentous day in the Federal Republic’s history as the steelworks in the city of Salzgitter, known as the Salzgitter Works, were dismantled by German workers and observed by representatives from the three Allied powers. Formerly under the umbrella of Reichswerke Hermann Goering, the works helped to fuel the German war machine, especially in the production of panzer tanks, planes and weapons. After Allied capture, the works sat unused for years, until now. This is a major loss of German industry, but needed to remove a symbol of Nazi industry and dominance."
 Adenauer49.7.d:0 "Today, the German Government is proud to announce the official end of food rationing within the Federal Republic. Since the end of World War II, a rationing plan was put into place concerning all matters of consumables, including coal, eggs, meat, oil and potatoes. The Allies helped to supplement this, but we have finally reached the point where it is beneficial to stop rationing as we have an ample supply of food and other consumables."
 Adenauer49.8.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag yet another debate raged, this time about the Federal Republic’s possible accession to the Council of Europe. The CDU started, with Chancellor Adenauer speaking on the reasons why the Federal Republic should join; the willingness of other European governments to include Germany, especially the willingness of the French government and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, and the benefits of entering into a union with other European democracies.\n\nThe SPD speakers countered, asking why the CDU insisted on this and urging delay until they could determine the real reasons why. The debate goes on, but we must make a decision soon."
 Adenauer49.9.d:0 "Today Chancellor Adenauer made a public announcement on all radio and television networks announcing a new decree. A resolution recently passed by the federal government concerning the constitutional loyalty of civil servants will go into effect; therefore, members of banned organizations cannot work in the federal government. Specifying that “persons in the service of the federal government must commit themselves to the democratic conception of the state through their entire conduct” and is directed towards 11 leftist organizations and 2 National Socialist organizations, including the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Kulturbund and the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime (VVN). Criticism for being authoritarian is bound to come soon, but this is needed for democracy."
 Adenauer49.10.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from the Federal Chancellery. An undersecretary to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Hans Globke, has been implicated in past Nazi actions, including having been responsible for drafting the Enabling Act of 1933 which allowed Hitler to have dictatorial powers; as well as several of the Nuremburg Race Laws targeting Jews. Globke was never a member of the Nazi Party, but was intimately involved with anti-Semitic efforts. After the war, Globke was exonerated of any wrongdoing and served as a witness at the 1948 Ministries Trial, then being appointed by Adenauer in 1949. The Chancellor has decided not to fire him, out of respect, but is prepared to face immense criticism for Globke’s past."
 Adenauer49.11.d:0 "A new report landed on Chancellor Adenauer’s desk today. Titled the “Himmerod Memorandum” after its drafting location of Himmerod Abbey, it lays the foundation for the establishment of a new German military force, called the Bundeswehr. Key demands included the release of all German soldiers convicted as war criminals, the cessation of defamation of German soldiers, and measures to transform domestic and foreign public opinion of the German military. The group of German officers who drafted it, including Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger, hope that the Chancellor will accept their memorandum and begin discussions with the three Western powers to satisfy their requests."
 Adenauer49.12.d:0 "Landsberg Prison is an infamous penal facility in Bavaria, best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and where Mein Kampf was written. Used by the American powers during the occupation for holding war criminals, it was renamed to War Criminal Prison Nr. 1 in 1946. Over the time of its existence, Landsberg was used for nearly 300 executions of condemned war criminals. Now, it is still used to house war criminals but is under our jurisdiction. On one hand, the time is nigh to release them; the death penalty is abolished in the Federal Republic, but on the other hand, keeping them imprisoned will set an example to those seeking undemocratic forms of government. What shall we do?"
 Adenauer49.13.d:0 "Today the Chancellor’s plane from Germany landed in London, and with great fanfare, Chancellor Adenauer met Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time since a German head of government had touched British soil in 20 years. Remarking on common Anglo-German goals; the preservation of peace and the defense of the democratic order, Adenauer gave an assurance that Germany would prove itself a steadfast ally. Dissuading fears of German economic competition and renewed nationalist movements, Adenauer stressed the importance of Germany in the question of Europe and defense of democracy. This truly was a success for German foreign relations and Anglo-German relations!"  
 Adenauer49.14.d:0 "Interesting proposals have been received by the three Western Allies and the Federal Chancellery. Apparently, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Chancellor Adenauer and the CDU characterize the notes as an aggressive action that attempts to stall the reintegration of West Germany into European politics, and even the SPD considers this a possibility. It seems clear that the government is united behind this, but a decision needs to be made, and soon."
 Adenauer49.15.d:0 "German-European integration continues today with the signing of the Bonn-Paris Conventions in Bonn between the three Western Allies and the Federal Republic. Important provisions include Article 1, which accords the Federal Republic “the full authority as a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs”, and Article 2, which provides that the Three Powers retain their rights concerning Berlin and all of Germany, including reunification and a peace settlement. This is a huge step for German sovereignty and European integration, and is only the first step in a long, long journey."
