 WGRElection.1.d:0 "The first West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher have the majority of the votes. A minority party still able to wield some influence is the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) rumored to have Soviet assistance. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.2.d:0 "The second West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.3.d:0 "The third West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.4.d:0 "After the five-year long military government, Germany is ready once more for a provisional election. With the fracturing of the SPD, the two competing parties are now the Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the German Party and Free Democratic Party coalition led by Heinrich Hellwege and Franz Blucher. Who will win?"
 Starting.1.d:0 "May 23, 1949 will be a momentous day for German history forever! Today, the work of the Parliamentary Council has come to reality as the Grundgesetz was signed and promulgated. Composed of members of West German state parliaments, the Council drafted the document and approved it, 53 votes to 12, on May 8. It was then put forth to state parliaments, being finally approved by all except the Bavarian Lander. This document, including the formation of the German federal government and providing crucial rights to all its citizens, marks the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany."
 Starting.2.d:0 "“(1) The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.\n(2) All state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the people in elections and plebiscites and by means of separate legislative, executive, and judicial organs.\n(3) Legislation shall be limited by the constitution, the executive and the administration of justice by legislation and the law.”\n\nArticle 20 is one of the fundamental articles of the Basic Law, describing the governmental structure of the Federal Republic and guarantees democracy, republicanism, social responsibility and federalism, being more direct than the past Weimar Constitution. As well, Article 20 has the privilege of not being able to be removed from the Basic Law as it guarantees democracy for all."
 Starting.3.d:0 "“For the time being, this Basic Law shall apply in the territory of the Laender Baden, Bavaria, Bremen, Greater Berlin, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. It shall be put into force for other parts of Germany on their accession.”\n\nArticle 23 focuses on the German Lander, or states. The Lander have always had a large part in German unitary government, and this article provides other de jure German states, not included in the field of application of the Basic Law, to declare their accession, or Beitritt, at a later date. This is designed to give the Lander a fair opportunity to join the Federal Republic, assuming they are recognized by the federal government and declared their accession via free self-determination. This truly is a watershed moment for relations between the federal government and the Lander in German politics."
 Adenauer49.1.d:0 "The debate on the new capital for the Federal Republic is raging in the new Bundestag. Currently, the capital is located in the western city of Bonn, on the banks of the Rhine River. However, members of the SPD have argued for a relocation of the capital to the city of Frankfurt, arguing that the city already has the required facilities and that it would be 95 million marks cheaper. However, CDU members are pushing back, arguing that Bonn is the provisional capital and the capital should not be moved until all of Germany is reunited. Where shall the capital be?"
 Adenauer49.2.d:0 "“I am afraid that the Western Allies, instead of pursuing a European policy, are getting into a policy of interest which tends rather to prop up an authoritarian Adenauer regime than to allow it to be replaced by a democratic regime… What we have to debate and to vote on today is nothing but a test of whether the Basic Law is a scrap of paper and whether the majority can continue in its endeavors to ride roughshod over it…”\n\nThis brought applause from the SPD side, and interjections and boos from the CDU side of the Bundestag chamber. Herr Doktor Arndt of the SPD continued to speak.\n\n“We thought we were on the way to a parliamentary democracy and find ourselves on the way to a monarchy without a constitution... Herr Chancellor, we shall not let you forget this oath!”\n\nChancellor Adenauer rose to speak, noting that the trade unions of Germany were behind the government in their earnest desire to sign the Petersberg Agreement, even though it addressed dismantlement of industries. This prompted questions from the SPD opposition, questioning the validity of the claim. This debate continued to rage on, but a decision must be made, quickly."
 Adenauer49.3.d:0 "On 29 December 1948, the three Western Allies as well as the three Benelux countries issued the Ruhr Statute, a special system of ordering the workings of the Ruhr industry. The Ruhr Authority envisaged by the Statute, a body consisting of representatives of the six powers, was established on 28 April 1949, including provision for representatives of the Federal Republic as members of the Authority.\n\nThis prompted a clash of opinions between the Government and, above all, the Social Democratic opposition on a question closely connected with the problem of dismantling, namely that of recognizing the Ruhr Authority by sending a German representative. In practice the function of this Authority would amount to control of the entire German economy because of the overwhelming importance of the industrial area of the Ruhr for all economic life in Germany.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting, Chancellor Adenauer explained that participation in the Statute would have favorable consequences; if we refused, it would amount to obstruction, and therefore, a thaw in Allied relations.\n\nHowever, the other argument was that domestically, membership would not be popular and Government support would stumble, especially in Landtag elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. Which way shall Germany go?"
 Adenauer49.4.d:0 "To commemorate the new decade of the 1950s, Chancellor Adenauer addressed the collected Bundestag chamber, as well as high-ranking government officials in a New Year’s Address. Beginning after applause, mostly from the CDU side of the chamber, he began.\n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Bundestag, Cabinet Ministers, foreign dignitaries and all those present, we are entering a new age. Less than a year ago, the Federal Republic was founded, and as we enter the 1950s, Germany will only grow more and more. Our relationships with the Western Powers only grow, while we pursue unification of Germany into one democratic state, not one controlled by one political party. As we enter a new age of technological development, Germany will be on the leading edge of this innovation, as we consolidate our limited industrial use for good. As I stand here, a testament to European democracy and peace is shown, and this shall continue forevermore!”"
 Adenauer49.5.d:0 "The reactions to German rearmament proposals by the Allies have been mixed within the Federal Republic’s government. The SPD’s position on German participation in a European defense community has been indeed hostile, with Dr. Schumacher considering CDU offers for rearmament to be premature, and is afraid that the Americans would make an offer that they could not keep. However, the CDU argues that the Soviet threat is large enough to warrant a rapid German rearmament, and that if they did not align with the Allies, the Federal Republic could be swept into the Soviet bloc, and would lose our sovereignty."
 Adenauer49.6.d:0 "Today is a momentous day in the Federal Republic’s history as the steelworks in the city of Salzgitter, known as the Salzgitter Works, were dismantled by German workers and observed by representatives from the three Allied powers. Formerly under the umbrella of Reichswerke Hermann Goering, the works helped to fuel the German war machine, especially in the production of panzer tanks, planes and weapons. After Allied capture, the works sat unused for years, until now. This is a major loss of German industry, but needed to remove a symbol of Nazi industry and dominance."
 Adenauer49.7.d:0 "Today, the German Government is proud to announce the official end of food rationing within the Federal Republic. Since the end of World War II, a rationing plan was put into place concerning all matters of consumables, including coal, eggs, meat, oil and potatoes. The Allies helped to supplement this, but we have finally reached the point where it is beneficial to stop rationing as we have an ample supply of food and other consumables."
 Adenauer49.8.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag yet another debate raged, this time about the Federal Republic’s possible accession to the Council of Europe. The CDU started, with Chancellor Adenauer speaking on the reasons why the Federal Republic should join; the willingness of other European governments to include Germany, especially the willingness of the French government and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, and the benefits of entering into a union with other European democracies.\n\nThe SPD speakers countered, asking why the CDU insisted on this and urging delay until they could determine the real reasons why. The debate goes on, but we must make a decision soon."
 Adenauer49.9.d:0 "Today Chancellor Adenauer made a public announcement on all radio and television networks announcing a new decree. A resolution recently passed by the federal government concerning the constitutional loyalty of civil servants will go into effect; therefore, members of banned organizations cannot work in the federal government. Specifying that “persons in the service of the federal government must commit themselves to the democratic conception of the state through their entire conduct” and is directed towards 11 leftist organizations and 2 National Socialist organizations, including the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Kulturbund and the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime (VVN). Criticism for being authoritarian is bound to come soon, but this is needed for democracy."
 Adenauer49.10.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from the Federal Chancellery. An undersecretary to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Hans Globke, has been implicated in past Nazi actions, including having been responsible for drafting the Enabling Act of 1933 which allowed Hitler to have dictatorial powers; as well as several of the Nuremburg Race Laws targeting Jews. Globke was never a member of the Nazi Party, but was intimately involved with anti-Semitic efforts. After the war, Globke was exonerated of any wrongdoing and served as a witness at the 1948 Ministries Trial, then being appointed by Adenauer in 1949. The Chancellor has decided not to fire him, out of respect, but is prepared to face immense criticism for Globke’s past."
 Adenauer49.11.d:0 "A new report landed on Chancellor Adenauer’s desk today. Titled the “Himmerod Memorandum” after its drafting location of Himmerod Abbey, it lays the foundation for the establishment of a new German military force, called the Bundeswehr. Key demands included the release of all German soldiers convicted as war criminals, the cessation of defamation of German soldiers, and measures to transform domestic and foreign public opinion of the German military. The group of German officers who drafted it, including Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger, hope that the Chancellor will accept their memorandum and begin discussions with the three Western powers to satisfy their requests."
 Adenauer49.12.d:0 "Landsberg Prison is an infamous penal facility in Bavaria, best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and where Mein Kampf was written. Used by the American powers during the occupation for holding war criminals, it was renamed to War Criminal Prison Nr. 1 in 1946. Over the time of its existence, Landsberg was used for nearly 300 executions of condemned war criminals. Now, it is still used to house war criminals but is under our jurisdiction. On one hand, the time is nigh to release them; the death penalty is abolished in the Federal Republic, but on the other hand, keeping them imprisoned will set an example to those seeking undemocratic forms of government. What shall we do?"
 Adenauer49.13.d:0 "Today the Chancellor’s plane from Germany landed in London, and with great fanfare, Chancellor Adenauer met Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time since a German head of government had touched British soil in 20 years. Remarking on common Anglo-German goals; the preservation of peace and the defense of the democratic order, Adenauer gave an assurance that Germany would prove itself a steadfast ally. Dissuading fears of German economic competition and renewed nationalist movements, Adenauer stressed the importance of Germany in the question of Europe and defense of democracy. This truly was a success for German foreign relations and Anglo-German relations!"  
 Adenauer49.14.d:0 "Interesting proposals have been received by the three Western Allies and the Federal Chancellery. Apparently, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Chancellor Adenauer and the CDU characterize the notes as an aggressive action that attempts to stall the reintegration of West Germany into European politics, and even the SPD considers this a possibility. It seems clear that the government is united behind this, but a decision needs to be made, and soon."
 Adenauer49.15.d:0 "German-European integration continues today with the signing of the Bonn-Paris Conventions in Bonn between the three Western Allies and the Federal Republic. Important provisions include Article 1, which accords the Federal Republic “the full authority as a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs”, and Article 2, which provides that the Three Powers retain their rights concerning Berlin and all of Germany, including reunification and a peace settlement. This is a huge step for German sovereignty and European integration, and is only the first step in a long, long journey."
 Adenauer53.1.d:0 "With a victory in the 1953 election, Konrad Adenauer has retained his position as Chancellor of the Federal Republic. Beginning his second government with largely the same cabinet as before, Adenauer has announced his intention to hand off the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a subordinate minister, at a date to be announced later. Additionally, it is expected that Theodor Heuss, current Federal President, is expected to remain in his position without much opposition. Political analysts domestically and abroad consider Adenauer’s continued leadership to be a benefit for West Germany and are expecting a continuation of greater economic and social rebuilding in the country."
 Adenauer53.2.d:0 "Nations around the world, particularly the three Western Allies, are outraged at talk of the release of the “Spandau Seven”; a group of Nazi war criminals interred in the Spandau Prison in Western Berlin including Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, and Rudolf Hess. After internal discussions in the Chancellery concerning the possible release of Konstantin von Neurath, former Foreign Minister of Germany and Erich Raeder, former Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine from Spandau, the Western Allies have largely condemned this action, but have not committed to any concrete action against it for the stability of the country."
 Adenauer53.3.d:0 "Celebrations abound in the Federal Republic today with the victory of the German national football team against the Hungarian “Golden Team” or “Mighty Magyars” in the final of the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Played at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, the Hungarian team was favored to win but was defeated. Considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history, and known as the “Miracle of Bern”, this victory has allowed a sense of regained international recognition and popularity of the Federal Republic on the world stage, attempting to fix its public perception after the Second World War and denazification."
 Adenauer53.4.d:0 "Events recently of top-level officials in the German Government have come as a shock to both those at home and abroad. Otto John, the President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution; the Federal Republic’s domestic intelligence agency, disappeared in Berlin several days ago after attending a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the July 20th plot against Hitler. Three days later, John appeared in communist East Berlin, disavowing his former country and criticizing Chancellor Adenauer’s policies of Western integration and remilitarization.\n\nThe German government has expressed outrage at this incident and are demanding his arrest and extradition from East Germany to our custody."
 Adenauer53.5.d:0 "A new foreign policy has been announced today at the Federal Chancellery. Named after State Secretary at the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, the Hallstein Doctrine prescribes that the Federal Republic will not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognized the German Democratic Republic, the illegal communist counterpart to our east. Based on the Soviet recognition of the GDR in March 1954, and our own recent agreements with the Soviets this year, we have the exclusive mandate to make this declaration based on the government’s right to represent the whole of Germany. This will for sure determine our future foreign policy, our outlook and standing on the world stage."
 Adenauer53.6.d:0 "Chancellor Adenauer returned from Moscow today, finishing a visit to the lion’s den for the West German government, and principally focusing on the return of the last German prisoners of war, a decade after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nTouching down in Moscow, Adenauer saw himself as an equal partner to the Russians, posing for a photo op with Soviet representative Nikolai Bulganin and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. However, negotiations stalled and threatened to dissolve, until the German and Soviet delegations attended a show of “Romeo and Juliet” at the Bolshoi Theater.\n\nTowards the end of the play, when the fathers embraced each other over the bodies of Romeo and Juliet, Adenauer and Bulganin stood up and embraced similarly, marking a poignant moment in the visit.\n\nSubsequent discussions proved fruitful, and agreements were reached; diplomatic relations with the Soviets, for the release of 10,000 POWs. Known as the “Homecoming of the Ten Thousand”, this success will forever be remembered in Germany, and beyond."
 Adenauer53.7.d:0 "It is official! With the ratification of the Paris Agreement on February 27, 1955, the Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European mutual security alliance founded by the three Western Allies and nine other countries in 1949. After having signed the NATO troop statute and other agreements establishing the end of the occupation regime, a ceremony was held in Paris celebrating the Federal Republic’s accession, and maneuvers with NATO forces and the Bundeswehr are expected to begin next year. This addition to the alliance is guaranteed to anger the Soviets and set the line of conflict at the inner-German border, entering into a new age in this Cold War."
 Adenauer53.8.d:0 "Today was no normal meeting of the Chancellor’s Cabinet. A situation had developed in the Middle East, and Chancellor Adenauer felt that it warranted a response.\n\nAdenauer opened. “Herr Brentano, what does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs know?”\n\n“Mr. Chancellor, as you know, Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal on July 26. It’s been just over three months now, and we have been informed that those two countries have deployed paratroopers to seize the Suez Canal.”\n\nThis prompted a flurry of conversation from around the cabinet table.\n\nAdenauer spoke above them. “We must make a decision; whether to honor our friendship with Britain and France; or to speak out in support of Nasser, offering diplomatic support.”\n\nBrentano spoke again. “Going against the Allies, especially the French, may not be wise right now. We are still trying to consolidate our position on the world stage. However, pledging support for the United Nations effort currently may prove as a neutral position; supporting Nasser by default, without directly intervening.”\n\nAdenauer considered the options, then placed the matter up to a vote of the Cabinet. What will our position be?"
 Adenauer53.9.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag an important issue was being debated, one that could change the borders of the Federal Republic; the issue of the Saarland.\n\nFrom 1947 onwards, the Saarland was detached from the French occupation zone and enjoyed political autonomy as well as an economic community with France, but was still under the control of a French High Commissioner. The German government under Chancellor Adenauer has continued its efforts to end the special status of the Saar and annex it into the Federal Republic as a Lander. While some people in the Saar protest that they should be sovereign, the majority of the country considers the Saar to be a part of Germany, an important economic component, and a way to wrest control of the area from France. What shall they decide?"
 Adenauer53.10.d:0 "The tension in the air was thick as senior officers of the new German Bundeswehr entered the smoke-filled chambers of the NATO Military Committee session. They approached the table and sat, facing representatives from the other fourteen NATO members.\n\nThe chairman began. “Today we begin the first day of discussions concerning the deployment of NATO nuclear weapons on territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. We welcome our colleagues from the Bundeswehr to share their input.” There was general clapping and nods of approval all around, as some members continued to smoke intermittently.\n\nThe most senior Bundeswehr officer began to speak. “If I may be so bold, I’d like to thank the members of this committee for allowing us to speak today. However, I feel that the Bundeswehr, and the government of the Federal Republic at large, has concerns about the deployment of nuclear weapons on our territory. We are on the front-lines, the battleground-”\n\nThe American representative interrupted. “Exactly! Now that the Federal Republic has joined NATO, we should turn our attention to placing more nuclear weapons on German soil, thereby extending our range and making it easier to strike the Soviets should that be needed.”\n\nThe senior Bundeswehr officer looked visibly angry. “You see, that’s the problem. We are a new country, with a small and new military. If nuclear weapons are placed on our territory, it presents a threat to the Soviet Union and gives them even more of a reason to attack!”\n\nThe American delegate shot back. “But you see, Article 5 guarantees your security now. The filthy commies wouldn’t dare to attack us!” He was silently shushed by the committee chairman, who looked like he needed a stiff drink. “Perhaps we should deliberate on this issue in closed session.”"
 Adenauer53.11.d:0 "Today in Rome, the Federal Republic participated in signing the Treaty of Rome, also called the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and proposed the reduction of customs duties and establishment of a customs union, as well as the creation of a single economic market. More importantly, this treaty established the European Commission, what would be the executive branch of the European Union. Signed by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and State Secretary of the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, Germany’s participation in this organization will certainly be a benefit to all!"
 Adenauer53.12.d:0 "An important ruling has come down from on high, the Federal Constitutional Court, the supreme court of the land. In determining the legal status of West Berlin, continuing to be occupied by the three Western Allies; the Court has determined that the city is a state of the Federal Republic. Determining the city as an individual Lander provides its citizens rights under the Basic Law. This is an unexpected development, particularly with the three occupying authorities in Berlin; God knows the Soviets will consider this to be a publicity stunt, however."
 Adenauer57.1.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag a major portion of German reform has been passed with the success of the General Consequences of War Act. This act, designed to cover all claims and damages from actions of the former German Reich and transfer them to the Federal Republic, will ultimately prove to be helpful to war reconstruction not just in Germany, but around Europe where damage is done. This is generally recognized as the German government taking complete financial responsibility for the actions of their fascist predecessors and has received broad popular support from the Western Allies."
 Adenauer57.2.d:0 "Today in Ulm the Einsatzkommando, or Einsatzgruppen trial, concluded. Held in front of the Ulm Regional Court, the case surrounded ten members of the Gestapo, Sicherheitdienst, and Ordnungspolizei, who were part of the Tilsit Einsatzkommando during the period of National Socialism. According to a report by Walter Stahlecker, former Commander of Einsatzgruppe A, these ten individuals have been accused of killing over 5,000 Jewish men, women and children near the Lithuanian border during the war.\n\nConsidered the first turning point in the judicial fight against the legacy of National Socialism, all ten defendants were sentenced to between 3 and 15 years in prison for “complimentary murder”, and lost their civil rights for up to 10 years.\n\nThis case has had profound effects, with the founding of the Central Office of the State Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to help begin the federal prosecution of all cases, allowing the Allies to see that the Federal Republic can police itself."
 Adenauer57.3.d:0 "On July 8, 1954, the Federal Republic of Germany was invited to the World Exhibition in Brussels, also known as Expo 58. Seeming politically sensitive, especially after Nazi Germany’s participation in the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris, this was a watershed moment for the Federal Republic.\n\nThe question of how the Federal Republic should present itself was hotly debated, with controversial debates being held in the Cabinet, until it was finally decided upon in 1956.\n\nThe German pavilion consisted of two stories, covered in glass, with a bridge allowing access over the Bundesautobahn 3. Fairly small compared to the larger US and Soviet pavilions, as well as the more infamous Belgian Congo pavilion, our contribution to Expo 58 represents a hopeful future for the Federal Republic."
 Adenauer57.4.d:0 "A new issue has reared its ugly head in the Bundestag. Ever since the Federal Republic’s accession into NATO and the meeting two years ago in front of the NATO Military Committee, the issue of nuclear weapons has haunted the federal government. Adenauer, and his cabinet, are in favor of NATO deploying nuclear weapons in the Federal Republic, as well as a possible independent nuclear program with France and Italy. However, the SPD has voiced numerous concerns to all aspects, starting with NATO deployment; considering it an overreach and a risk to the safety of not only German citizens, but possible reunification with the East.\n\nAdenauer’s Cabinet, in consultation with SPD members, has proposed a referendum concerning this issue so that the people can decide.\n\nHowever, the issue may be blocked by the Federal Constitutional Court, who has preemptively signaled that allowing nuclear weapons would be unconstitutional under Article 26 of the Basic Law.\n\nShall the referendum go on, reflecting the will of the people, or shall this issue be struck down, once and for all?"
 Adenauer57.5.d:0 "The referendum on nuclear weapons deployment has been held in all of the German federal states, on the order of the German federal government. Millions of eligible Germans lined up in their respective polling locations today, as the nation decided on the fate of NATO nuclear weapons deployment in the Federal Republic. While there has been little comment from NATO Headquarters in Brussels, it is expected that a public statement will follow the announcement of the results. What did the nation choose?"
 Adenauer57.6.d:0 "Yet another cabinet meeting was called today, this time in response to an issue raised by the German embassies in London, Paris, and Washington, concerning a Soviet note sent to the governments of the three latter countries.\n\nAdenauer was already seated, as was the rest of the cabinet, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Heinrich von Brentano, hurried in, hands full with briefing materials and printouts.\n\nAdenauer started. “Brentano, what’s the latest?”\n\nBrentano responded. “Chancellor, the Soviets have indicated…well, rather, demanded… that the Allies pull their troops out of West Berlin, and that the city be a Free City.”\n\nThis prompted a lot of vigorous discussion from the room, which Adenauer spoke over. “Well, I gather that this cabinet does not agree on most of those points, and therefore-”\n\nHe was cut off by a junior minister, the Minister of All-German Affairs. “Sir, maybe this wouldn’t be such a bad idea- Berlin could be free, and the Soviets might back off.” Brentano broke in again. “That’s a terrible idea. We should take a harder line against the Soviets- after all, what did we join NATO for?” Adenauer paused, thinking."
 Adenauer57.7.d:0 "The German federal government has come under renewed pressure by Western powers to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line, which is currently the border between the Polish People’s Republic and the German Democratic Republic, formed after the Potsdam Conference by the flow of the Oder and Neisse Rivers. While the Americans have especially pressured Adenauer and his cabinet to recognize the line via non-aggression pacts, segments of the German population, particularly the German expellee demographic, have realized his possible motives and are swinging into action against recognition of Poland. Shall the line be recognized?"
 Adenauer57.8.d:0 "It is with regret that Theodor Oberlander, former Minister for Displaced Persons, Refugees, and Victims of War, and member of the Bundestag, has been forced to retire from service with the government of the Federal Republic. With a report earlier this year, Oberlander has been implicated in promoting and committing war crimes in Poland during the Second World War, as well as endorsing ethnic cleansing in Poland, of the people that he soon came to lead as the leader of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights.\n\nIt is expected that the Adenauer cabinet will make a public statement on this, but will deny the accusations outright and wish Oberlander a safe retirement."
 Schumacher49.1.d:0 "Today was yet another turbulent day in the halls of the new Bundestag. In the midst of a fierce debate surrounding the basic functioning of the new West German government, the Opposition Leader, Konrad Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Union, rose to speak.\n\nStanding on the right side of the room with the rest of the CDU behind him, he began. “My fellow members. As we emerge from the horrors of the war with a new and democratic government, the ruling Chancellor, Herr Schumacher, has taken our Federal Republic in a new and dangerous direction. As we try to step back onto the world stage, Herr Schumacher mocks the Allies and desires to pursue greater cooperation with the East-”\n\nHe was cut off by an uproar of fierce boos and heckling from the much larger left side. The boos continued until an SPD deputy approached the dais, raising his voice and interrupting Adenauer.\n\n “Herr Adenauer… I cannot begin to express my, and the party’s contempt with your remarks. The Christian Democratic Union is not only aware of, but complicit in, the sheltering and protection of former National Socialists.”\n\nA gasp went up among nearly the entire room, but the CDU deputies continued to scowl.\n\nHe continued on. “I have in my hand a list of numerous prominent officials within the CDU that were members of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party including Hans Globke and Theodor Oberlander, as well as hundreds and thousands of members, functionaries, and bureaucrats. This half-hearted acceptance of former war criminals and traitors into the conservative movement is unconscionable and undemocratic, and is why we, as the Social Democratic Party, fully condemn the CDU for its actions.”\n\n Raucous applause came throughout the room, as Adenauer appeared shocked, and the CDU either remained quiet or began to heckle towards the other side of the room."
 Schumacher49.2.d:0 "Today was a momentous day in Frankfurt, as a group of officers and men stood outside the Romer, the city hall complex. Dressed in military-style uniforms, but without any insignia, they waited, standing in formation until a group of men in suits emerged, with Chancellor Kurt Schumacher in front. A small group of press and other officials were gathered near the nearly 500 men standing in five square-like formations. Chancellor Schumacher approached the podium, flanked by Vice Chancellor Egon Franke and Federal President Erich Ollenhauer.\n\nHe began. “My fellow citizens, today is an important day; not only for our country’s security, but for the Western world at large. I have the honor to present the first 500 officers and personnel of the new Federal Border Police, or Bundesgrenzschutz. These men will help secure our border from communist threat or incursion, ensure the safety of our transportation networks, and begin to provide policing services on a federal level. I should stress that the BGS is not a military force. The East may accuse us of rearming and will denounce and condemn our actions with harsh rhetoric, but I say one thing. Every country deserves internal peace and security of its’ borders, and Germany should be no different.”\n\nAfter some applause, he was handed a piece of paper from an aide. “I am now honored to give the new oath of the BGS to its first five companies of officers. Raise your right hand.” Five hundred hands were raised.\n\n“I swear to uphold the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and all laws applicable to the Federal Republic, and to conscientiously fulfill my official duties, so help me God!”\n\nCameras flashed as the men immediately started cheering, clapping and tossing their hats into the air. Chancellor Schumacher looked out into the field of feldgrau, then at Ollenhauer and Franke respectively, who both smiled. It was a banner day for the Federal Republic indeed, and more men would be sworn in today, and in the coming days."
 Schumacher49.3.d:0 "Chancellor Schumacher entered the Cabinet meeting room, waltzing in as Vice Chancellor Egon Franke nodded for the ministers to sit. Schumacher sat with a cup of coffee, nodding at the Minister of Foreign Affairs to begin.\n\n “Sir, the Allied Control Commission has given to us the draft text of the Petersberg Agreement. They are heavily pressuring us to sign it, as it includes some allowances for us to pursue some semblance of independent sovereignty.”\n\nSchumacher, after reading some portions of the text, spoke up rather loudly. “What business do the Allies have dictating their demands on our new country? We should refuse to sign and denounce the Allies’ terms as unreasonable.”/n/n Vice Chancellor Franke spoke up. “All due respect to Herr Schumacher, but we really have little choice in this matter. The Western Allies liberated us. These terms seem generally beneficial for us, aside from the Ruhr issue… but we can negotiate that one with them.”\n\nSchumacher piped up again. “Gentlemen, listen. It’s not the terms that I’m opposed to. I have issues with the Allies forcing unreasonable economic and military demands on us in return for a negligible amount of sovereignty. This needs to be done another way, in my opinion.”\n\nFranke looked around the room, saw some nods, some frowns. “Let’s put this to a vote; sign the agreement, or refuse, and make alterations?”"
 Schumacher49.4.d:0 "On radios across Germany, the voice of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher began to boom. Tonight was a memorable moment, as the Chancellery had announced a nationwide speech on new policy matters.\n\n “My fellow Germans. Tonight I am proud to present the new policy program of the Social Democratic Government, one that we have named the ‘Frankfurt Program’ after our shining capital. This program will be separated into three points, which I will go over, all meant to strengthen our country, help our people, and restore our reputation on the world stage.\n\n “First, we will embark on a new Volks economic program, meant to regain our economic power from the postwar damage and the grasp of the Allied Control Commission. This will propel our country to economic levels not seen ever before!”\n\n “Second, the issue of internal political strife has plagued our nation from both sides, both former National Socialists and extant Communists. Our Government will embark upon a harsh program of putting down extremism as a way of fermenting democracy and securing trust in our new institutions.”\n\n “Lastly, our Government will reconsider our foreign policy positions. It has become clear that in some respects, the West German Government and the Allied Powers cannot agree on issues, including the issue of the Ruhr and on militarization. A serious look will be taken at our relations with the powers of Europe and the powers of the world.”\n\n “These three points, in tandem, shall secure our country and help all people. Thank you all and good night.”"
 Schumacher49.5.d:0 "FROM; Provisional Federal Ministry of Economics\nTO; Federal Chancellery\nSubject; Outline of the ‘Volks’ Economy Program\n\nThe West German Government, in its limited provisional capacity, has come up with some crucial points to the new ‘Volks’ Economy Program, the economic segment of the SPD’s Frankfurt Program. Below is a list.\n\n-Formation of a Permanent Federal Ministry of Economics and Unions\n-Introduction of social insurance plans\n-Seizure of Ruhr coal facilities\n-Prioritization of resources for domestic economic use\n-Nationalization of Volkswagen and IG Farben\n-Passage of better working regulations for steel and mine workers\n\nWe believe that these six points have the capability to rebuild our domestic economic and production power."
 Schumacher49.6.d:0 "In Munich’s Marienplatz, a rather large crowd of people gathered, all facing a podium with the West German seal emblazoned on it. As a series of three black Mercedes cars pulled into the square, excitement began to move in the air. Chancellor Schumacher stepped out, flanked as always by Vice Chancellor Franke and President Ollenhauer. After welcoming the attendees, he began.\n\n “I’m sure some of you are wondering why I chose Munich to make this speech. Not only is this one of the most beautiful cities in all of our Republic, but this city has bore witness to political extremism from both sides, from the infamous failed Beer Hall Putsch of the National Socialists to the short-lived Munich Soviet Republic.”\n\n “We have learned from our mistakes of the past, and are fully committed to stamping out the flames of Nazism and Communism from every corner of this country. The ‘Black and Red’ Campaign aims to secure our democracy by punishing and removing all those who aim to overthrow it. Our government will embark on this as soon as possible, while respecting the rights of our people. Thank you all.”\n\n Applause resounded around the square as Schumacher waved, smiling at the audience before motioning for a car."
 Schumacher49.7.d:0 "It was early morning as a black Mercedes rolled down the highway towards the steel mills of the Ruhr. Marked with the insignia of the International Authority for the Ruhr, two men sat, as they turned off the road and approached one of the frequent steel-producing and coal-mining plants dotting the landscape.\n\nIt came as a shock when the car stopped just before the factory’s gate, with a roadblock in front of it, flanked by two Bundesgrenzschutz officers, both with holstered pistols.\n\nRolling the windows down, the Ruhr Authority official driving looked furious. “What’s the meaning of this, Lieutenant?”\n “Sir, this steel mill is officially the property of the Federal Republic of Germany and you are not authorized to enter.”\n “What the hell? We’re with the International Authority for the Ruhr. Here’s our papers. We manage this facility.”\n\n The lieutenant didn’t even bother to examine the documents when handed to him. “Sir, I have direct orders from the Federal Ministry of the Interior to not allow access to any unauthorized personnel into this facility, including Ruhr Authority personnel. Please turn your vehicle around or means of force will be administered.” The officers placed their hands on their holsters.\n\n The two men looked at each other, then at the officers. “This is insane.. Your commanding officer will be hearing about this.” The Mercedes was turned around, and as the car merged back into the highway back towards Dortmund, the man in the passenger seat remarked “Some calls will have to be made.”"
 Schumacher49.8.d:0 "FROM; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\nTO; President Juan Peron, Government of the Argentine Republic\nSubject; Extradition of Former National Socialists\n\nDear President Peron,\n\nIt has come to the attention of my new government that many former National Socialists, or ‘Nazis’ have fled to countries such as Argentina, who has offered them safe haven from our prosecution or Allied prosecution.\n\n We are aware of the following individuals within Argentina that the Federal Republic of Germany would like to be extradited so that we can prosecute them under our laws;\n\n-Josef Mengele, known as the “Angel of Death”, who committed medical experiments in SS concentration camps\n-Josef Schwammberger, SS Commandant in Poland\n-Erich Priebke, SS commander responsible for the 1944 Ardennes Caves massacre\n-Gerhard Bohne, responsible for the administrative logistics of the Aktion T-4 euthanasia program\n\nExtraditing these individuals into our custody as soon as possible may have some diplomatic benefits in the future."
 Schumacher49.9.d:0 "FROM; Headquarters, Bundesgrenzschutz, Federal Ministry of the Interior\nTO; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Federal Chancellery\nSubject; Deportations of Communists to the German Democratic Republic\n\nChancellor,\n\nDeportations of approximately 5,000 registered members of the Communist Party of Germany and other related organizations have been carried out, with all of them being sent to the German Democratic Republic via conventional rail and road routes. All persons have been banned from entering the Federal Republic in the future.\n\nIt is our hope that approximately two to three thousand more individuals will be deported within the coming weeks and sent to the GDR or other bordering communist countries.\n\nSIGNED\nAnton Grasser\nInspector, Bundesgrenzschutz."
 Schumacher49.10.d:0 "Federal Ministry of the Interior, IS Department - Surveillance Log and Profile of Max Reimann\n\nSubject is Max Reimann, Chairman of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Aged approximately 53 years old, Reimann served on the advisory board of the British Occupation Zone from 1946-1948, becoming chairman of the KPD in 1948. In the 1949 elections, Reimann and his party won approximately 7% of the vote, and is currently serving as a member of the Bundestag.\n\nIdeology\nReimann exhibits average Marxist-Leninist political beliefs and values. In his position as KPD chairman, he has railed against nearly every part of the West German Government, including the Grundgesetz, Federal Chancellor, Federal President, and legal system. Our intelligence indicates this rhetoric will continue and may turn violent based on future events.\n\nSummary of Recent Activity\nOne week ago, Reimann made a statement in the Bundestag condemning not only the CDU, but the ruling SPD party as well for its clear “tolerance of western imperialism”. Two days ago, our intelligence revealed a meeting between Reimann and other western communist party leaders, including Belgian communist Julien Lahaut and French communist Jacques Duclos, as well as telephone calls to East Berlin and SED officials. This represents a major threat to the internal security of the West German Government.\n\nIn conclusion, the Intelligence Division will continue to monitor all movements, statements, telephone conversations and all other forms of communication involving Reimann, and will prepare additional reports as it concerns national security."
 Schumacher49.11.d:0 "As a DC-6 airliner landed at Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Chancellor Schumacher paced in his office. Located miles and miles away from the airport in the city, Schumacher was nervous, understandably. Why wouldn’t he be worried? This would be a massive PR move for the German Government, but McCarthy had been a little more than problematic in US domestic circles.\n\nBefore he knew it, Schumacher was down in Frankfurt’s main square, outside of the Romer, with fanfare, Ollenhauer and Franke behind him, shaking hands with Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, the famous American anti-communist.\n\nSitting down to a meeting, the two remained very cordial, with McCarthy thanking Schumacher for inviting him.\n\nDiscussing the intricacies of the Black and Red Campaign, McCarthy seemed impressed, and later, he attended a tour and inspection of BGS units in Frankfurt, noting the professionalism and skill of the BGS troops.\n\nAt the end of the day, Schumacher’s government came out on top - even the CDU is impressed at this show of anti-communist support, while the KPD menaces from the shadows." 
 Schumacher49.12.d:0 "It was yet another standard meeting of the cabinet this morning, and Schumacher was uncharacteristically early, with Ollenhauer and Franke being shocked to see him be one of the first in the room, with his normal cup of coffee. As the rest of the ministers arrived in the room, sitting down, Schumacher started the meeting.\n\n “Gentlemen, we must discuss the intricacies of the third point of our government program - the foreign policy aspect. We must agree on a path forward on the world stage. I’ll now take any suggestions.”\n\n Franke immediately started speaking. “Herr Chancellor, we must, and I mean must, continue with our policy of Western integration. It is the only way forward. I say this as a proud SPD member, but the West can truly help us in ways that we would never imagine.”\n\nOllenhauer retorted. “Herr Vice Chancellor, I disagree strongly. Why should we kneel to the West even more than we have already? Dealing with the Petersberg Agreement was only the first test in this. There are members of this government who want an independent Germany, not constrained by any power or bloc, and I believe that is what’s best for our people right now, not being pulled in any direction by the East, or the West.\n\nSchumacher had heard enough. Attracting the attention of all the ministers in the room, he called a vote; continue with Western integration, or pursue a non-aligned path?"
 Schumacher49.13.d:0 "To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing on behalf of the West German Government, concerning the Allied Control Commission’s push for West German rearmament.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party has considered it inadvisable for Germany to rearm for the safety of its people and strongly condemns the rhetoric of the CDU and Allied Powers in forcing German rearmament as a ploy for Germany to be the next battleground in this “Cold War” of ours.\n\nThe German people seek safety and security, from the posturing of the East, or the West. We condemn all attempts to rearm in the near future; the foundation of our Federal Border Service was only meant to secure ourselves internally and will never be used for external use. Any further attempts to convince us of this will not be viewed positively. Thank you."
 Schumacher49.14.d:0 "After Schumacher’s cabinet decided to move forward with Western integration, against the wishes of Ollenhauer, the next topic of discussion was the Schuman Plan, a proposed economic agreement with the French that would create a “European Coal and Steel Community” drafted by French foreign minister Robert Schuman.\n\nFranke started the discussion, saying “This seems as a fairly easy decision. If we desire to continue with Western integration, this is one of the necessary steps in doing so. The mere fact that the French trust us after the last half-century of history between our two countries is a good sign, and I see no reason why we refuse to enter into this history-making agreement.” He had made a good argument, even eliciting applause from those ministers more aligned with Ollenhauer.\n\nSchumacher acknowledged this, but then motioned to his Federal President to speak.\n\n “Herr Franke, I see many reasons why we shouldn’t join this agreement. It is clear that ever since the Petersberg Agreement was given to us, we have been forced to bow to the Western Allies and do whatever they wish. This is clearly what the CDU wants to do - why should we commit to the same policy? How do we know that the French, in their proposed ECSC, won’t simply take our coal and steel for themselves,  just like they took the Ruhr in 1923?”\n\nThis last point caused the room to erupt in a chorus of general displeasure, opposition and anger.\n\nSchumacher had heard enough. “Order! Gentlemen, let’s behave like politicians and vote on this!”"
 Schumacher49.15.d:0 "It was a sunny day in Washington as a crowd gathered in the Foxhall Village neighborhood of the District, just west of Georgetown. The new German Cultural Center, or Deutsches Kulturzentrum, had finished construction merely weeks ago, and now, officials from the Federal Republic and the United States had arrived to dedicate and open the building to the public. Chancellor Schumacher was not present, as he was busy, but Federal President Erich Ollenhauer had been sent in his ceremonial duties as head of state, albeit begrudgingly.\n\nOllenhauer had told himself that this was still a good thing, cultural exchange was important between countries, but seemed bitter that Schumacher asked him specifically; a man who supported not joining the West, to go to the West and hobnob with American diplomats.\n\nShaking hands with US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, the two discussed the intricacies of cultural exchange, suggesting maybe future student exchange programs in the future. Exchanging cordialities was something that Ollenhauer disliked, but it was part of his job, and as the two discussed the difference between German bratwurst and Austrian schnitzel, pairs of scissors were handed to them by aides.\n\n “It must be time,” Ollenhauer said, smiling slightly at Acheson, as they walked to the ribbon wrapped near the front of the building. As cameras flashed, the two smiled as they cut the ribbon, marking the official opening of the German Cultural Center and continued cooperation and support between the United States and West Germany."
 Schumacher49.16.d:0 "As we return to the Bundestag chamber again, a fierce debate was raging, this time concerning the status of Allied occupation forces in West Germany. The president of the chamber was attempting to gavel the CDU member speaking down, who was screaming about the “SPD’s incompetence in our national defense” and the “need for American troops”. Once some semblance of quiet was reached, an SPD member rose to speak, beginning.\n\n “How could the CDU and their partners be so brainwashed and confused is beyond me. All due respect to the mission of the Allied occupation forces, but their presence is unwanted, unwarranted at this point, and they are taking up valuable resources that our country needs to rebuild. We have a stable, social democratic government, and we do not need foreign troops patrolling our streets and driving their tanks down our autobahns. The BGS is enough to solve our internal security issues, we do not need Americans doing it for us. I therefore ask this chamber to vote on a resolution asking for the voluntary departure of Allied occupation forces from our country.”\n\nThe room exploded in chaos of heckling, general displeasure, raucous cheers and applause from the SPD side, and yells of “Maintain the status quo” from the CDU and FDP. The president banged his gavel to restore order, then saying “I declare a vote on this resolution. Voting will commence now by secret ballot.”"
 Schumacher49.17.d:0 "FROM; Chancellor Kurt Schumacher, Government of the Federal Republic of Germany\nTO; Max Petitpierre, President of the Federal Council of Switzerland, and Tage Erlander, Prime Minister of Sweden\nSubject; European Neutrality\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI hope this note finds you well. As you know, the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany is pursuing a non-aligned form of diplomacy, pushing away the influence of the Western and Eastern Blocs. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has viewed the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of Sweden as two neutral, potentially friendly countries that the Federal Republic would like to further relations with, in our fight against superpowers in this “Cold War.” I hope to work further with your countries in the future."
 Schumacher49.18.d:0 "As the plane began its approach to Belgrade Airport, Schumacher finished his glass of cognac, having it whisked away before the plane bounced to a stop. It was late afternoon, as Schumacher was welcomed by a brass band and formation of troops of the Yugoslav People’s Army. Shaking hands with the Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff, Schumacher was taken to a car, which whisked him away to the center of Belgrade, where he was met with similar fanfare by the General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Josep Broz Tito. Exchanging pleasantries, the two men and their diplomatic counterparts soon got to business; this was no ordinary diplomatic visit.\n\nThe two talked about the similarities between their countries; Tito’s experience with Stalin, and Schumacher’s experience with the Western Allies. Both agreed that the tactics of the Western and Eastern Blocs were corrosive to their people, and while Schumacher hated communism with a burning passion, he had fundamental respect for Tito, a man who truly cared about his people.\n\nThe trip lasted a week, with both parties agreeing to open formal diplomatic relations and continue friendly relations in the future."

 SchuStroke.1.d:0 "As the maid rapped on the door to Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s private bedroom, she became increasingly more and more worried. This was unlike him to still not be awake so late, especially as a cabinet meeting was to occur in less than an hour.\n\nFumbling with a ring of keys, she finally managed to get the door open, and looking in, she saw the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kurt Schumacher himself, slumped over in bed, unconscious. The maid let out a blood-curdling scream, attracting the attention of passing butlers and other chancellerial staff, who rushed in with similar reactions of shock.\n\nOut of nowhere, Schumacher’s chief of staff, Dietrich Steube arrived, trying to calm the situation down.\n\n “Get the Vice Chancellor and Federal President down here right now! Assemble the cabinet, but tell Franke he’s in charge until we can get the situation dealt with.”\n\nPointing at the assembled staff, he said, “Call for the Chancellor’s doctor! We need to get him to a hospital immediately!”"
 SchuStroke.2.d:0 "Only a short few hours after the discovery of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher having a stroke, the Cabinet of the Federal Republic assembled, led provisionally by Vice Chancellor Egon Franke. While Federal President Erich Ollenhauer wasn’t required to be there, he was in the room anyway, especially considering the discussion would center around the recent leadership change.\n\nThe Cabinet was shocked, as the ministers whispered to each other. Franke opened the meeting.\n\n “I’m sure all of us are rightfully concerned and shocked to hear that the Chancellor had a stroke this morning in his residence. I have been assured that he is being taken care of at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit and is in stable condition.” A sigh of relief blew through the room.\n\n “Now, we must come to the core subject of this Cabinet meeting. There is no clear line of succession for if the Chancellor is incapacitated or killed, and now that we are faced with this potential situation, a decision must be made.”\n\nOllenhauer spoke up from the corner of the room. “As Vice Chancellor Franke is not explicitly the legal successor of Chancellor Schumacher, he should not be the country’s leader at this point.” The room became a little louder at this point but Ollenhauer kept talking.\n\n “The Federal President is the head of state and therefore, is in a better position to act as the country’s temporary leader.”\n\nFranke shot back. “As the Vice Chancellor, I am the Chancellor’s direct successor, nominated by him directly. What more reason would I have?”\n\nA minister spoke up. “We must vote on this. Whatever the case may be, the Bundestag will have to vote on the successor assuming that the Chancellor is not able to recover.” Franke nodded. “Very well then. Herr Ollenhauer, may the best man win. Please record your vote on a slip of paper and deposit it with the chief of staff, who will count the votes.”"
 SchuStroke.3.d:0 "“With the advice and consent of the West German Cabinet, Vice Chancellor Egon Franke has been confirmed as the temporary Chancellor of West Germany, in the wake of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s recent stroke. As a personal pick of Schumacher upon arriving in office, Franke is uniquely qualified to lead the country in this time of great need.”\n\nFranke smiled at the front-page article in Frankfurt’s largest newspaper. Turning to the small group of people in the Chancellery, he placed his left hand on a copy of the Basic Law, and raised his right hand.\n\n “I swear that I will dedicate my strength to the well-being of the German people, enhance what is to its advantage, ward off what might harm it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, fulfill my duties conscientiously and do justice to every man, so help me God.”\n\nAmid raucous applause, one figure was not clapping; Erich Ollenhauer, the Federal President, who, as constitutionally required, was present at the swearing in. Hopefully, he thought, this wouldn’t last long."
 SchuStroke.4.d:0 "“With the advice and consent of the West German Cabinet, Federal President Erich Ollenhauer has been confirmed as the temporary Chancellor of West Germany, in the wake of Chancellor Kurt Schumacher’s recent stroke. As Schumacher’s counterpart as head of state, Ollenhauer is ideologically aligned with Schumacher, much to the chagrin of Vice Chancellor Egon Franke, who holds a more right-wing view in the SPD. However, Ollenhauer has proven himself during his time as Federal President as being ready and willing for the challenge ahead of him.”\n\n Ollenhauer smiled, reading the article in the front page of Frankfurt’s largest newspaper. Turning to the small group of officials in the Chancellery, he placed his left hand on a copy of the Basic Law, and raised his right hand.\n\n “I swear that I will dedicate my strength to the well-being of the German people, enhance what is to its advantage, ward off what might harm it, uphold and defend the Basic Law and the laws of the Federation, fulfill my duties conscientiously and do justice to every man, so help me God.”\n\nAmid raucous applause, stood a man who was placed in a precarious situation; Egon Franke, still as the current Vice Chancellor, a rival of Ollenhauer, now sidelined as his second-in-command. Hopefully, he thought, this wouldn’t last long."
 SchuStroke.5.d:0 "As Ollenhauer came into the cabinet room, he was confused. Only weeks into his temporary duties as Chancellor, he had a diplomatic situation to defuse.\n\nDirecting his attention to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ollenhauer began to listen.\n\n “Herr Chancellor, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Sir, we need to handle this as soon as possible.”\n\nOllenhauer spoke. “As much as I appreciate our colleagues in Washington and London, they seem to label nearly everything as a Soviet plot against them. I believe that Germany should be neutral in this new and rapidly expanding Cold War - but if it’s on the Soviets’ terms, I would not be so quick to judge.”\n\nFranke began to speak. “Sir, while I agree, I must strongly protest. We should not be giving this Soviet ploy any more time. Unification is important, but not under these circumstances.”\n\nOllenhauer nodded. “Very well, Herr Franke. Let’s put this to a vote.”"
 SchuStroke.6.d:0 "Ever since the tragic stroke suffered by Chancellor Schumacher, the debate on succession in the Government has raged. In order to solve this issue, a group of SPD politicians led by Provisional Chancellor Ollenhauer have put forward an amendment to the Basic Law laying down a line of succession for the Federal Chancellor in the future. Meant as an complement to Article 57, the amendment is read as follows:\n\n “In the event of the inability of the Federal Chancellor to perform the duties of his office or in the event of a premature vacancy in the office, the functions of the Federal Chancellor will be held by the Federal President, followed by the Vice Chancellor and the President of the Bundesrat.”\n\nIn private discussions, Vice Chancellor Egon Franke has considered this a sidelining of his authority, especially after his ousting as Chancellor during the initial succession crisis. It is expected to pass the Bundestag, particularly as a bipartisan issue to the succession issue of several weeks ago."
 SchuStroke.7.d:0 "With much fanfare, Kurt Schumacher returned to the Federal Chancellery in Frankfurt, returning from his recovery and rehabilitation at Hospital of the Holy Spirit from his stroke. While preparing to be re-sworn in, Schumacher received meetings with the Provisional Chancellor, Federal President and other officials. Ollenhauer, sounding rather pleased to see Schumacher return, wished him well and was pleased to go back to Federal President with Schumacher’s return. Franke’s reaction though, was rather different. All being for preserving the line of succession and rule of law, he felt sidelined by Schumacher and Ollenhauer’s amicable relationship, and even being the Chancellor’s pick for deputy, he was chagrined to return to his old role.\n\nWith his hand on the same copy of the Basic Law as was used for the swearing in of former Chancellor [WGR.GetLeader], Kurt Schumacher was back!"
 SchuStroke.8.d:0 "It was another raucous day in the Bundestag, but this time concerning a different issue. After the recent return of Kurt Schumacher as Chancellor, the CDU and FDP had understandable opposition to his reappointment, considering it a political move to consolidate SPD power.\n\n A CDU deputy rose to continue the debate, beginning. “Let’s look at this logically, something I know my colleagues on the left aren’t capable of doing.” Laughter from the CDU, boos from the SPD side.\n\n “The Chancellor suffers a stroke, god help him. He is replaced by another SPD minister as a Provisional Chancellor, as the line of succession is debated to death. But, Chancellor Schumacher comes back? And the German people are supposed to be fine with this? The transition from one minister to another, without any oversight from the Bundestag, or from the people directly? Is Chancellor Schumacher’s condition even really stable? He’s already suffered one stroke, what’s to say he won’t suffer another?”\n\n He was quickly stopped by a chorus of boos and yelling, even from some members of his own party. The crack at Schumacher’s condition had gone too far, but the SPD would have to respond to this, as a deputy stood up to speak.\n\n “To respond to the CDU deputy to my left - your comments about the Chancellor’s condition are unwarranted and not appropriate in this chamber! And to address the concerns levied about the transition; it was necessary to maintain the stability and working government of the Federal Republic while the Chancellor rested and recovered. Since his condition has improved, he was reappointed as Chancellor, mostly because he was duly elected by the people to serve. The CDU would have done the same had it happened to Herr Adenauer.”\n\n Shocked silence from the CDU side echoed. No one rose to speak. Meanwhile, the SPD deputies looked over with smirks, not even laughing. The SPD wins again."
 SchuStroke.9.d:0 ""Schumacher sat in his office one rainy Saturday night, reminiscing on the past few years. Winning the Chancellery, becoming the first SPD leader of Germany in decades, accomplishing leaps and bounds in policy, only to have it all come crashing down with his stroke and recovery. There had been the whole business of the succession which the CDU and its propaganda apparatus had attempted to tear to pieces. Schumacher had done all that he could, and between the two deputies fighting over SPD rule, one aligned more with Schumacher’s ideology and policy: Erich Ollenhauer.\n\nIt was time to prep him, whether Franke liked it or not. Looking out the window, he buzzed for his secretary.\n\n “Bring Erich in.”
