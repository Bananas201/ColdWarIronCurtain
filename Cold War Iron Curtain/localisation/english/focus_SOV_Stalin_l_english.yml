 Soviet_Op_North.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union is accused of deporting thousands of Jehovah Witnesses from the Baltic and other Eastern European areas to Siberia. Reports indicate the Ministry of State Security recently carried out decrees on the deportations and confiscation of properties. The numbers of Jehovah Witnesses are said to be in the thousands. The Jehovah Witnesses have long run afoul of Soviet authorities by refusing to participate in state functions, including serving in the military. For many Soviet officials, these religious beliefs represented a direct challenge to the state that had to be rooted out before it spread to other populations. The action is likely to garner some international criticism over religious persecution."
 SOV_PRC_Treaty.1.d:0 "The two global socialist giants have much to gain in cooperation. The treaty guarantees an alliance between China and the Soviet Union. The treaty ensures desperately needed aid to the new Chinese regime. The ports of Dalian and Lushun will also be returned to China. The Soviets gain privileges in Xinjiang and Manchuria. Both states will benefit as the socialist world unites in partnership."

 SOV_Stalin_Suspend_Claims_on_Turkish_Lands_desc:0 "One of the issues we've been trying to press is that of the Turkish Straits, because ownership of them would give us full access to the Mediterranean and oceans beyond. However, it is outside our sphere, so we should abandon our claims."
 SOV_Stalin_Delay_Austrian_Independence_desc:0 "The Austrians and the other three Allied Powers are pressing us for Austria's independence, however we feel that the Austrians should remain under our grasp for a while longer, as they've been responsible for two world wars and we would not like a third."

We have 2 main goals here. The 1st, naturally, is our control of the Turkish Straits. The Second is the creation of a state for the oppressed Kurds in Turkey."
 SOV_Stalin_Recognize_the_Peoples_Republic_of_China_desc:0 "Happy that our brotherly Communist Chinese forces have won their civil war, we will be first to internationally recognize the new government of the People's Republic of China, and will take back our recognition of the bourgeois imperialist Republic of China."

 SOV_Stalin_Call_For_A_General_Peace_in_Asia_desc:0 "Comrade Stalin and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged leaders on both sides, communist and imperialist, to come to an agreement over land disputes, instead of fighting and dying. This is a bizarre change of heart for Stalin."

 SOV_Stalin_Deportation_of_Jehovahs_Witnesses_desc:0 "Jehovah's Witnesses are a strange people, and should not be publicly worshiping in an atheistic state. Those individuals will be rounded up and deported where they can worship their "Jehovah" alone."
 SOV_Stalin_Dismantle_The_Jewish_Anti_Fascist_Committee_desc:0 "The JAC was originally formed under the guise of spreading the glory of Communism and the Union abroad to fellow Jewish communities, but it is now clear what they truly intend. The JAC is nothing more than a tool of the Bourgeoisie."

 STALIN_Invest_in_the_Baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic region has suffered much in the past few decades, being assimilated into the Union less than a few years before being run over by the German War Machine, and then bearing the effects of Scorched Earth policies. Investing in to the area will only do good."
 STALIN_Rebuild_Stalingrad_desc:0 "Stalingrad is home of the graves of many heroes of the Union, and site of one of our finest moments of the Great Patriotic War. However, all that doesn't change the devastation it saw during the battle for it, and we need to restart its industries. "

 STALIN_Eliminate_Infrastructure_Bottlenecks_desc:0 "The state of our roads and general infrastructure, while being a useful tool to slow the Nazi advance, is in a miserable state for peacetime commerce, and must be improved."

 SOV_Stalin_Establish_A_New_Diplomatic_Stance_desc:0 "Our new diplomatic stance will appear to the west as a softer one, perhaps turning the Iron Curtain into a chain-link fence.
