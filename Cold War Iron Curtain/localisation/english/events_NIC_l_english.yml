 nic.5.d:0 "Coffee is on the most numerous exports of Nicaragua. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 19th century. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production requires significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws have therefore been passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. Profits from coffee production flows abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee are virtually nonexistent."
 nic.6.d:0 "Some civilians, several exiled Nicaraguan military personnel, and other active military personnel, who disagree with President Somoza Garcia have planned a coup d'état. Rumours say that even Emiliano Chamorro has something to do with this.\n\n On [GetDate] an ambush was set off on the Southern Managua highway with the intention of capturing President Somoza Garcia, on his way to Montelimar hacienda. It was planned and mounted by dissident officers of the National Guard together with a group of young conservatives and one or two liberals, who rejected Somoza's rule. When the capital hears about the coup, they hear that..."
 nic.7.d:0 "President Somoza has just informed me that two members National Guard were killed, one wounded today in attempt to assassinate
him. Three truckloads arms and ammunition smuggled from Costa Rica with full knowledge Costa Rican officials especially Colonel Herrera of Civil Guard, the President claimed. Attempt made to ambush him last night on leaving reception my house but he told us then that he had been tipped off and guards ran men away from nearby city water tank. Today, two guardsmen attempted to stop suspicious truck on road to Montelimar but occupants opened fire. A motorcycle policeman joined the fray and he and one guardsman killed and the other guard wounded. Child passing by also killed. Assailants escaped but are believed to be surrounded. Somoza told Colonel Layton there were fourteen men in truck. Colonel Rogers says air force spotted abandoned truck containing ammunition and he learned some men in jeep were arrested in front my residence gate last night.\n\nPresident told Layton he was declaring martial law. President claims General Chamorro2 back of plot. Chamorro failed appear my reception last night which was unusual, Somoza then commenting on it."
 nic.8.d:0 "The plan was defeated and those involved were captured and Subsequently, most of these prisoners were taken to some coffee plantations in the Department of Carazo and cruelly executed, some few were left alive, taken to the military prisons of the Loma de Tiscapa, later tried in Council of War, those summarily executed were partially burned and buried in a common grave.\n\nA small group of rebels who had managed to escape from the trap set by the National Guard and who were heading towards the Costa Rican border on board a truck, were captured at Cuatro Esquinas and all were executed by troops commanded by Captain Agustín Peralta Ruiz.\n\nFaced with so much repression, many went into self-exile directly or took refuge in some embassy; the pacts were broken and General Emiliano Chamorro ordered the withdrawal of the conservative deputies and senators from the National Congress, but not all of them paid attention to him."
 nic.9.d:0 "The age of Anastasio Somoza Garcia has come to an sudden end when he was killed during a coup d'état, done by disgrunteled military and civilan personnel. In his place rises a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone, leading the Frente de Salvación de Nicaragua. He has promised to transition Nicaragua into a true democracy. Already many former Somoza supporters are leaving the country."
