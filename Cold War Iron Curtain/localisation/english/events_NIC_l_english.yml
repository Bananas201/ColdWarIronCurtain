 nic.5.d:0 "Coffee is on the most numerous exports of Nicaragua. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 19th century. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production requires significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws have therefore been passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. Profits from coffee production flows abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee are virtually nonexistent."
 nic.6.d:0 "Some civilians, several exiled Nicaraguan military personnel, and other active military personnel, who disagree with President Somoza Garcia have planned a coup d'état. Rumours say that even Emiliano Chamorro has something to do with this.\n\n On [GetDate] an ambush was set off on the Southern Managua highway with the intention of capturing President Somoza Garcia, on his way to Montelimar hacienda. It was planned and mounted by dissident officers of the National Guard together with a group of young conservatives and one or two liberals, who rejected Somoza's rule. When the capital hears about the coup, they hear that..."
 nic.7.d:0 "President Somoza has just informed me that two members National Guard were killed, one wounded today in attempt to assassinate him. Three truckloads arms and ammunition smuggled from Costa Rica with full knowledge Costa Rican officials especially Colonel Herrera of Civil Guard, the President claimed. Attempt made to ambush him last night on leaving reception my house but he told us then that he had been tipped off and guards ran men away from nearby city water tank. Today, two guardsmen attempted to stop suspicious truck on road to Montelimar but occupants opened fire. A motorcycle policeman joined the fray and he and one guardsman killed and the other guard wounded. Child passing by also killed. Assailants escaped but are believed to be surrounded. Somoza told Colonel Layton there were fourteen men in truck. Colonel Rogers says air force spotted abandoned truck containing ammunition and he learned some men in jeep were arrested in front my residence gate last night.\n\nPresident told Layton he was declaring martial law. President claims General Chamorro back of plot. Chamorro failed to appear in my reception last night which was unusual, Somoza then commenting on it."
 nic.8.d:0 "The plan was defeated and those involved were captured and Subsequently, most of these prisoners were taken to some coffee plantations in the Department of Carazo and cruelly executed, some few were left alive, taken to the military prisons of the Loma de Tiscapa, later tried in Council of War, those summarily executed were partially burned and buried in a common grave.\n\nA small group of rebels who had managed to escape from the trap set by the National Guard and who were heading towards the Costa Rican border on board a truck, were captured at Cuatro Esquinas and all were executed by troops commanded by Captain Agustín Peralta Ruiz.\n\nFaced with so much repression, many went into self-exile directly or took refuge in some embassy; the pacts were broken and General Emiliano Chamorro ordered the withdrawal of the conservative deputies and senators from the National Congress, but not all of them paid attention to him."
 nic.9.d:0 "The age of Anastasio Somoza Garcia has come to an sudden end when he was killed during a coup d'état, done by disgrunteled military and civilan personnel. In his place rises a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone, leading the Frente de Salvación de Nicaragua. He has promised to transition Nicaragua into a true democracy. Already many former Somoza supporters are leaving the country."

 nic.11.d:0 "Jose Figueres Ferrer, a moderate socialist, was elected president of Costa Rica in 1953. Our president Anastasio Somoza is certain that he participated in a plot to assassinate him with Caribbian Legion help (the legion had backed Figueres in his election); Somoza quickly made plans to retaliate and decided to contact Rafael Calderon Guardia, a disgruntled former president of Costa Rica, who would lead a band of rebels south from Nicaragua into Costa Rica. Lucky for us, Calderon is onboard with the plan, and promises adequate payment should we succeed."
 nic.12.d:0 "Urgent news from our Nicaraguan border: forces loyal to the disgruntled former president Rafael Calderón have crossed the border and commenced an invasion. The rebels have alreadya seized the border town of Villa Quesada. Meanwhile, our government is mobilizing its police forces, the Civil Guard, and paramilitary groups of government supporters to confront the invaders. We must ask the Organization of American States to intervene before it's too late."
 nic.13.d:0 "The Organization of American States found the Nicaraguan government was supporting the rebels and as soon as this was announced, the Nicaraguan government ended its support of the rebels. The United States sold Costa Rica four fighter planes, while the rebels were overwhelmed by the popularly backed government forces. After some fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were pushed out of Costa Rica. Jose Figueres accused the CIA of covertly aiding Nicaragua's invasion by sending pilots and sorties to covertly attack Costa Rica, notably subjecting at least 11 villages to machine gun fire."
 nic.14.d:0 "The Organization of American States has not found the funder for Calderonista Rebels. After fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were able to launch an uprising against Figures. As a result, Figures resigned and Rafael Calderón assumed the presidency."
 nic.15.d:0 "Luis Somoza Debayle formalized his grip on the presidency through fraudulent elections in February 1957 which were boycotted by all the opposition except the puppet Conservative Nationalist Party. The Social Christian Party was created in reaction to these elections and received support from younger Conservatives dissatisfied with their party’s inability to make any political impact on the dictatorship."
 nic.16.d:0 "In the midst of Luis Somoza's ascension, on Summer 1957 Luis Somoza promulgated a decree of broad and unconditional amnesty. The time covered by this amnesty decree extends from 1950 to the date of its publication in La Gaceta, the official state newspaper. It places much emphasis on the events of 1954 and does not mention the tragic events of 1956, related to the assassination of his father, but since it extends to the day this amnesty decree is promulgated, Luis Somoza was also amnestying the executors and all those possibly implicated and all prisoners and exiles, both guilty and innocent in the death of Somoza Garcia, as well as those implicated in subsequent tortures and deaths."
 nic.17.d:0 "Despite the many reforms of Luis Somoza, a seizable opposition remains. With Fidel Castros triumph in Cuba and his dedicated efforts to export his revolution and, in addition, his deed has stimulated the concerns of many to emulate that odyssey, including those here at Nicaragua.\nIn the plains of Olama, a plane coming from Punta Llorona, Costa Rica has landed with 45 armed insurgents, eager to overthrow the government of Luis Somoza. Another group has landed in Mollejones, in the Chontal valley, near Santo Tomás. The combatants belong to groups of the Nicaraguan bourgeoisie, along with Cuban rebels.\nIf that isn't enough, in El Chaparral expeditionary forces led from Cuba by Che Guevara are invading aswell. As a consequence, the students, mainly in Leon, are holding large demonstrations."
 
 
 nicr.1.d:0 "Nicaragua has just had an revolution. From what we know, an opposition to Anastasio Somoza Garcia launched a coup against him, during which he was killed. The new leader is a former National Guard officer Adolfo Baez Bone. He has assured us that this will not affect our good relations."
 nicr.2.d:0 "Today is the day for our truely free and fair elections. It is contested between the Conservative Party and the Independent Liberal Party.\nPartido Conservador is the oldest existing party in Nicaragua. It was founded during the 19th century, as Nicaragua established itself as an independent republic, by members of the elite of Granada. It aims to keep the good relatioship Nicaragua has with US.\nPartido Liberal Independiente was formed when it separated from Somoza's Nationalist Liberal Party in 1944. It maintains itself as a succesor to the old Liberal Party."
 nicr.3.d:0 "The fate of the Partido Liberal Nacionalista is currently being discussed. Whilst initially it still featured a liberal agenda (the Liberals having been one of the two main parties of Nicaragua since the 19th century along with the Conservatives), the Nationalist Liberal Party later developed into little more than a political vehicle for the kleptocracy of the Somoza clan. When Anastasio Somoza García took power in 1936, the party aligned itself with the United States and other caudillos in Latin America, like Rafael Trujillo, Oswaldo López Arellano and Fulgencio Batista.\n\nNow, a proposal has been brought forward. In it, we would allow the former members to join our party, Partido Liberal Independiente. Doing so could help us look better than the brutal Somoza regime.\nSome are however worried that their inclusion could bring Nicaragua back to the dictatorship. Of course, we could always allow some mebers to join, with restrictions like excluding them from top leadership positions."
 nicr.4.d:0 "Urgent news have arrived. It appears that President Enoc Aguado Farfán has died in a car bomb. This happened at around 9:30 this morning while the president was travelling to a press conference in Leon. The president and two others who were in the car have been killed.\nThe motive for this attack is unknown according to the police. However, some are suscpeting that former members of the Somoza administration are to blame. Following a quick leadership election, the new president is René Schick Gutiérrez, a former member of the Nationalist Liberal Party, now the United Liberal Party."
