Northerners Walk Out
Today at the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Northern members of the party staged a walkout, after Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was nominated overwhelmingly by his fellow Southern Democrats. Faced with extremely strong opposition to their proposed civil rights plank, the Northern faction is forced to form a third party convention, likely to be held in Minneapolis, in the coming weeks.

Southerners Walk Out
Today at the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Southern members of the party staged a walkout, after Senator Herbert Lehman of New York was nominated overwhelmingly by his fellow Northern Democrats. Angered by proposed additions of civil rights and other progressive policies to the national Democratic party platform, the Southern faction is forced to form a third party convention, likely to be held in Montgomery, Alabama, in the coming weeks.

Northern Liberal Party Convention
After their walkout of the national Party Convention in Chicago, the Northern Democratic faction has assembled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to nominate their candidate. Composed of the Northern faction of the national Democratic Party as well as the Minnesota Democratic Farmer-Labor Party (DFLP) and the North Dakota Democratic Nonpartisan League (DNPL), they are expected to nominate Senator Herbert Lehman of New York to their presidential ticket.

Southern States Rights Democratic Party Convention
After their walkout of the national Party Convention in Chicago, the Southern faction has assembled in Montgomery, Alabama, to nominate their candidate. Composed of the now renamed States Rights Democratic Party, they are expected to nominate Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to their presidential ticket.

United States vs. Louisiana (1950) Ruling
Today, the United States Supreme Court released a ruling in the case of United States v. Louisiana, a case involving the jurisdiction of offshore oil and petroleum deposits. In this, the federal government sued the Louisiana state government for not recognizing the right of the federal government to use that land and continuing to trespass on it. The Court ruled that the federal government has paramount rights over the territory and oil rights and that Louisiana, much like the state of California in a similar suit from three years prior, has no rights to oil and petroleum in a submerged area. Not expected to sit well with states’ rights advocates, this ruling continues to emphasize the supremacy of the federal government.

Bill to Revert Oil Control to the States
Today, the Submerged Lands Act was passed by the US Congress. Meant to soothe states’ rights advocates angered by the Supreme Court ruling in US v. Louisiana, this Act reverts oil and gas rights back to individual states with coastal borders, up to 3 nautical miles from the coastline. This bill is particularly controversial, as many federal government advocates argue that the federal government should have full control over all oil and gas rights within its borders. Will we sign it or veto this bill?
